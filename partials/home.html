        <figcaption>GMO technology aims to create crops with enhanced nutritional value and resistance to pests</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>GMOs in our food supply remain contentious in agricultural science. Proponents highlight increased yield, enhanced nutrition, and improved disease resistance, with examples like beta-carotene-rich Golden Rice addressing vitamin A deficiency in developing regions. Environmental concerns include potential cross-pollination creating "superweeds" and questions about agricultural sovereignty due to concentrated seed ownership among few corporations.
    </p>
    
    <p>While scientific consensus from organizations like the American Medical Association indicates GMOs pose no greater health risks than conventional alternatives, public skepticism drives demands for transparent labeling and comprehensive studies. A balanced approach to regulation—evaluating each GMO application on specific merits within particular agricultural contexts—offers the best path forward for food security.</p>

        <figcaption>Our vision of 2100 balances technological advancement with environmental sustainability</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>By 2100, Earth faces multiple potential futures determined by our actions on climate, technology, and social organization. Temperature increases between 1.5°C and 4.5°C could bring sea level rise and extreme weather, though emerging technologies might enable effective decarbonization. With global population projected to stabilize around 10-11 billion, aging demographics will require reimagined economic systems while automation transforms labor markets beyond recognition.
    </p>
    
    <p>Food systems will need to balance feeding more people with reducing environmental impact through innovations like vertical farming and lab-grown proteins. Healthcare advances may dramatically extend lifespans, while virtual technologies blur physical-digital boundaries. The most hopeful scenario envisions societies harnessing technology for ecological regeneration, creating a world where prosperity and sustainability become complementary necessities rather than competing values.</p>
